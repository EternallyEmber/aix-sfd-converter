NAME
       mpegdemux - MPEG1/2 system stream demultiplexer


SYNOPSIS
       mpegdemux [options] [input [output]]


DESCRIPTION
       mpegdemux(1)  is  an MPEG1/MPEG2 system stream demultiplexer. It can be
       used to list the contents of an MPEG system stream and to extract  ele-
       mentary streams.

       mpegdemux(1) has four primary modes of operation:

       scan   In  this  mode  the MPEG system stream is scanned for elementary
              streams.

       list   In this mode the contents of an MPEG system stream are listed in
              a  textual  form. This is useful to get an overview of what's in
              an MPEG file

       demux  In this mode elementary streams are extracted from an MPEG  sys-
              tem  stream.  The system stream packet structure is dissolved in
              the process. Typically each extracted stream is written  to  its
              own file.

       remux  This is like demux, except that the MPEG system stream structure
              is left intact. This means that the output is again an MPEG sys-
              tem stream with all but the selected elementary streams removed.


OPTIONS
       -a, --ac3
              AC3 sound packets in DVD MPEG2 streams have a 3 byte header that
              is neither part of the MPEG specification nor of the AC3  speci-
              fication. When this option is used, these 3 bytes are removed to
              produce a correct AC3 stream. Note that this option  applies  to
              all  selected  substreams without checking whether they actually
              contain an AC3 elementary stream.

       -b, --base-name name
              When demultiplexing more than one stream, the output file  names
              can  be  set using this option. To generate the output file name
              for a stream, every # character in name is  replaced  by  a  hex
              digit  of  the  stream  id.  For  example,  to extract all video
              streams in one go, use something like

              $ mpegdemux -d -b video_##.m1v -s 0xc0-0xcf src.mpg

              to get files video_c0.m1v, video_c1.m1v, ...

       -c --scan
              Scan a system stream for elementary streams. This is the default
              mode. All streams and substreams are automatically selected when
              using this option.

       -d, --demux
              Demultiplex an MPEG system stream. The demultiplexed streams are
              written  to  the  output  file  unless the --base-name option is
              used. If the --base-name option is not used, only one stream can
              be  demultiplexed  (if  more streams are specified, they will be
              randomly interleaved in the output file).

       -D, --no-drop
              Don't drop incomplete packets in demuxing and remuxing mode.

       -e, --no-end
              Don't print end codes in listing mode. Additionally, in remuxing
              mode, make sure that there is exactly one end code at the end of
              the stream.

       -E, --empty-packs
              When streams are  removed  during  remuxing,  packs  can  become
              empty.  Including  these  empty packs in the output is pointless
              and therefore is not done by default. Use this option  to  force
              inclusion of all packs.

       -F, --first-pts
              In  scan  mode,  in addition to each stream's first packet, also
              list the packet with the lowest presentation time stamp.

       -h, --no-system-headers
              Don't print system headers in listing mode. Additionally, in re-
              muxing mode, don't repeat system headers.

       -i, --invalid spec
              Select  invalid streams. Packets of invalid streams are not rec-
              ognized as packets and their contents are parsed as MPEG  system
              stream  data  rather than being skipped. This is useful for bro-
              ken/incomplete streams. The syntax for spec is the same  as  for
              -s.  Additionally, if spec is "-" then all streams that have not
              yet been selected by -s are made invalid.

       -k, --no-packs
              Don't print packs in listing mode.

       -K, --remux-skipped
              Copy bytes that are skipped while looking for a start code.

       -l, --list
              List the system headers, packs and packets  in  an  MPEG  system
              stream.

       -m, --packet-max-size size
              Set the maximum packet size to size. Packets in the input stream
              that are larger are considered invalid. As with the  -i  option,
              the  packet  is  not  simply  skipped  but parsed as MPEG system
              stream data.

       -p, --substream spec
              This option selects private substreams. Whenever Private  Stream
              1  (0xbd)  is selected using -s, the substreams within that pri-
              vate stream can be selected using -p. The syntax for spec is the
              same as for -s.

       -P, --substream-map id1 id2
              Remap substream id1 to id2 when remuxing.

       -r, --remux
              Remultiplex an MPEG system stream. The output MPEG system stream
              is written to the output file.  Many  options  control  what  is
              copied from the input to the output and what is discarded.

       -s, --streams spec
              This  option  selects  streams. spec specifies the stream IDs in
              the following form:

              [+|-]<id>[-<id>]{/[+|-]<id>[-<id>]}

              where id is either a numeric stream ID or one of all or none.  A
              "-"  in  front  of  an ID range means exclusion. For example the
              spec

              -s 0xc0-0xcf/-0xc2

              selects all video streams (0xc0 - 0xcf) except stream 0xc2.

       -S, --stream-map id1 id2
              Remap stream id1 to id2 when remuxing.

       -t, --no-packets
              Don't print packets in listing mode.

       -u, --spu
              This option is used to extract DVD subtitles.  It  is  necessary
              because the subtitle streams on DVD don't contain all the timing
              information (the time stamps  in  the  packet  headers  are  re-
              quired).  If this option is used during demultiplexing, the out-
              put files for all substreams are written in the  following  for-
              mat:

              "SPU " (4 bytes)

              PTS (8 bytes, MSB first)
              SPU packet

              PTS (8 bytes)
              SPU packet

              and so on

       -x, --split
              Split  the remuxed stream at sequence boundaries. This option is
              only meaningful in remuxing mode. It can not  be  used  together
              with  the  -e  option.  The  individual sequences are written to
              files whose name was set with the -b option.

EXAMPLES
       Scan a system stream for elementary streams:

       $ mpegdemux -c -v src.mpg


       List the contents of an MPEG system stream:

       $ mpegdemux -l -k -s all -p all src.mpg


       Extract the first video stream:

       $ mpegdemux -d -s 0xe0 src.mpg dst.m1v


       Extract all audio streams:

       $ mpegdemux -d -s 0xc0-0xdf -b audio_##.mpa src.mpg


       Remove the second video stream:

       $ mpegdemux -r -s all/-0xc1 -p all src.mpg dst.mpg


       Extract the first AC3 audio stream from a DVD MPEG2 system stream:

       $ mpegdemux -d -s 0xbd -p 0x80 --ac3 src.mpg dst.ac3


       Exchange the first and the second audio stream:

       $ mpegdemux -r -s all -p all -S 0xc0 0xc1 -S 0xc1 0xc0 src.mpg dst.mpg
